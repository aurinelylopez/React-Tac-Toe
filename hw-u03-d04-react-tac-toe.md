# React-Tac-Toe

Remeber your tic-tac-toe games? It seems like years ago! This weekend your home work is to follow the [tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html#getting-started) from the react documentation and create a tic-tac-toe game with react.

You'll need to deploy this project when you're done. We learned about a new tool in class today called Now. Use Now to deploy your app and provide the link in your issue ticket.

The tutorial gives you two ways to follow along. You will be using your text editor so follow those instructions. There are specific instructions for configuring your file structure so make sure to follow those steps. If you haven't configured your editor for react highlighting you can follow the links in the tutorial to get it set up.

This is a long and involved tutorial so be sure to follow the steps closely and in order. It's also super informative so be sure not to blindly copy and paste but actually read each step and understand what you're doing.

Your homework submission should include a link to your deployed app and your repo containing your code. The code in your repo should be extensively commented. If there are no comments in your code your submission will not be marked as complete.

### Bonus:
- Style it up! Feel free to reuse the code from your original tic-tac-toe.
- Add more components. Think of Some UI elements that might make your game better and add them as components.
